CHEMBL3705431,"FLIPR Assay: Activation of the mGluR5 receptor expressed in cell lines results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Using calcium sensitive fluorescent dyes and a suited fluorescence plate reader this functional response is detectable and quantifiable. This technique could be used to characterize pharmacological modifications of the mGluR5 receptor.[Ca]i measurements were performed in HEK293 cells stably expressing the full-length human mGlu5a receptor under the control of a tet-regulated promoter. Cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 ug/ml HygromycinB, 500 ug/ml G418 and 2 ug/ml Tetracycline in a 37, 95% humidity and 5% CO2 incubator. Confluent cell cultures were split on a bi-weekly schedule.72 hours prior to the assay run mGluR5a expression was induced by replacing the culture medium by DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum without antibiotics."
CHEMBL3706069,"Calcium Mobilization Assay: The cDNA for rat metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (rmGluR5) and the cDNA for human metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (rmGluR5) were generous gifts from S. Nakanishi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The rmGluR5 or rmGluR5 was stably expressed in a HEK 293 cell line and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with supplements (10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin and 0.75 mM G1418) at 37 C., 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to assay, cells were seeded into 384-well black wall microtiter plates coated with poly-D-lysine. Just prior to assay, media was aspirated and cells dye-loaded (25 uL/well) with 3 uM Fluo-4/0.01% pluronic acid in assay buffer (Hank's Balanced Saline Solution (HBSS)): 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, plus 20 mM N-2-Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.5 mM probenicid)."
CHEMBL3706070,"Radioligand Binding Assay: Binding assays were performed as described in [J. A. O'Brien et al. Mol. Pharmacol., 2003, 64, 731-740] with slight modifications, including that a radioligand that binds to the methyl-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) binding site was used in place of [3H]-MPEP. Briefly, after thawing, the membrane homogenates were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.9% NaCl binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 ug is protein/well for radioligand filtration binding. Incubations included 5 nM radioligand, membranes and either buffer or varying concentrations of compound. Samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with shaking. Non-specific binding was defined with 10 uM cold MPEP when using the radioligand. After incubation, samples were filtered over a GF/C filter (presoaked in 0.25% polyethyleneimine (PEI)) and then washed 4 times using a Tomtec Harvester 96 Mach III cell harvester (Tomtec, Hamden, Conn.) with 0.5 mL ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl."
CHEMBL3706272,"Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) Assay: Activity of compounds of the present invention was examined by determination to what extent the glutamate-induced elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration in L(tk-) cells expressing human mGluR5a receptors (see L. P. Daggett et al., Neuropharm. Vol. 34, pages 871-886, 1995) is inhibited by utilizing methods as described e.g. by L. P. Daggett et al., Neuropharm. Vol. 34, pages 871-886 (1995) and P. J. Flor et al., J. Neurochem. Vol. 67, pages 58-63 (1996). Activity of compounds of the present invention with respect to mGluR1 antagonism was examined by an assay based on measurements of L-glutamate induced intracellular calcium increases using a 96 well plate-based Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR)."
CHEMBL3707570,"Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Activity Assay: The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as negative allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity, in particular mGluR5 activity, can be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with rat or human mGluR5 were plated in clear bottom assay plates for assay in a Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS). The cells were loaded with a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye (e.g., Fluo-4), and the plates were washed and placed in the FDSS instrument. Test compound was applied to cells 3 seconds after baseline readings were taken. Cells were incubated with the test compounds for 140 seconds and then stimulated with an EC20 concentration of an mGluR5 agonist (e.g., glutamate, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, or quisqualate); 60-80 seconds later an EC80 concentration of agonist was added and readings taken for an additional 40 seconds. Data were collected at 1 Hz. Negative allosteric modulation of the agonist."
