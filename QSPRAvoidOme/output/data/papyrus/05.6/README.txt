Papyrus version: 5.6
Total number of files: 14

===================

Papyrus is an aggregated dataset of small molecule bioactivities.

Changes since version 05.5
    - apply small molecule filter that filters out compounds with a MW < 200
        or > 800, heavy metal containing compounds and mixtures
    - include TID column which contains information on the original protein
        identifier

The very high quality Papyrus++ data in contained in the 
05.6++_combined_set_without_stereochemistry.tsv.xz file.

The other data is split into 3 tab-separated files:
    - 05.6_combined_set_without_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
        This file contains the highly standardized and normalized data.
        Although not containing stereochemistry, it provides the highest
        quality of the data. This file can be readily used.
    - 05.6_combined_set_with_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
        This file contains standardized and normalized activity values
        but molecules are not standardized. It is of lower confidence than
        the data above although containing stereochemistry.
        By "molecules are not standardized" we mean that sources have
        applied different standardization processes and the reported
        stereochemistry may vary for the molecule the activities relate to.
        It is recommended to standardize the data before using it.
    - 05.6_combined_set_protein_targets.tsv.xz
        This file contains data about protein targets (e.g. sequence, organism,
        classification).

In addition to these, molecular structures are available in SDfile format:
    - 05.6_combined_2D_set_without_stereochemistry.sd.xz
        This file contains the unique molecules found in
        06.5_combined_set_without_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
    - 05.6_combined_3D_set_with_stereochemistry.xd.xz
        This file contains the unique molecules found in
        05.6_combined_set_with_stereochemistry.tsv.xz
